This repo is a public copy from Taylor University's GitLab. It includes scripts that were used to analize the 2024 total solar eclipse, and were writen by Charlie Mikels, Ian Oatis, Ethan Elliott, and Ethan Sosnowski.

See the paper _Investigating Stabilization in Lower Stratospheric Temperature and Atmospheric Gravity Waves During the April 8, 2024, Total Solar Eclipse_ for more information.

The original dataset is not included. It is available on request from NearSpace Launch.

## Requirements

The included scripts were written with Python v3.13.3 and utilize these libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `PyWavelets`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `folium`

You can install them all at once using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy scipy PyWavelets matplotlib seaborn folium
```
